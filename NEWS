# News for the resemble package
## Versions 1.0 and 1.1.1
* 19.03.2013 Hello world! Initial release of the package

## Version 1.1.2
* 23.04.2014 Added default variable names when they are missing 
             and an error message when the names of Xr do not match
             the names of Xu.
* 23.04.2014 plot.mbl draws now the circles around the actual centre
             function when the spectra is not centred for mbl
* 20.03.2013 The function movcorDist was removed since.
             it was included by mistake in the previous 
             version of the package. The corDiss function  
             can be used in raplacement of movcorDist.
