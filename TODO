## 30.11.2015: orthoDiss retuns "Error: not a matrix" when applied to a single matrix (Xr)
## 30.11.2015: Perform a detailed check of the orthoProjection, plsProjection and pcProjection.
## 19.11.2015: Modify the way in wich the error parameters of the cross validation for wapls 1 and 2 are computed.
## 18.11.2015: Check documentation.
## 18.11.2015: check the gaussian process function since it retrieves poorer results than in the previous resemble version (only in NNv validation, the predictions are actually good). The scale argument now does something
##		different to what it was doing before (scale and centering: both x and y). If at the and stays like that 
##		check documentation and indicate that both x nd y are centered and scaled


## 31.08.2014: There is a bug in the orthoDiss function, when Yr is a matrix containing different variables
It seems to be that works in windows but not in linux? is because the version of R
As an example see the internal code in "soil_contest_exploratory_analysis.R"
pc.dis <- orthoDiss(Xr = data.tr$spec, X2 = data.pred$spec,
                    Yr = data.tr[,soil.attr[-2]],
                    pcSelection = list("cumvar", 50),
                    method = "pls",
                    local = FALSE,
                    center = TRUE, scaled = TRUE,
                    return.all = FALSE, cores = 30)

On the other hand when method = "pls" or method = "pca" it would be good to include the results from the simEval or the explained variances

set.seed(1)
pc.proj <- orthoProjection(Xr = matrix(rnorm(length(Yr) * 200), length(Yr), 200), 
X2 = matrix(rnorm(length(Yr) * 200), length(Yr), 200),
                    Yr = Yr,
                    pcSelection = list("cumvar", 1),
                    method = "pls",
                    local = FALSE,
                    center = TRUE, scaled = TRUE)



pc.dis <- orthoDiss(Xr = matrix(rnorm(length(Yr) * 200), length(Yr), 200), 
X2 = matrix(rnorm(length(Yr) * 200), length(Yr), 200),
                    Yr = rnorm(length(Yr)),
                    pcSelection = list("cumvar", 1),
                    method = "pls",
                    local = FALSE,
                    center = TRUE, scaled = TRUE,
                    return.all = FALSE, cores = 3)
